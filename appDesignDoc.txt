	Feature/Page list:
	- pokemonRaising
		- power up possibilities
		- move ratings
		- future: track evolves and power ups
	- pokemonFinding
		- identify pokemon sightings for a given set over a specific amount of time
			- number of times / day in area
			- likelihood to find in area
			- spawn coordinates (need a way to group close locations)
			- map where select pokemon previous spawnings are shown 


	data model
		user.settings
			- pokeSearchRequestSettings : {
				recency :	
			}
			- pokeSearchRequest []
		pokeSearchRequest		(createRequest, serverRunRequest, getRequests)
			- location
			- pokesToFind []
			- pokesightings []
		pokesighting
			- expirationTime
			- lat
			- long
			- pokeID

	publication design
		- pokemonFinding Page: 
			1) subscribe to all user's pokeSearchRequests
			2) onChange to pokeSearchRequest.pokesightings publish added sightings
			
		


	walk-through
		user creates pokeSearchRequest
			- get coordinates from map click
			- onCreate do initial serverSearchRequest
				- calls API 
				- iterates through returned sightings
					- if unique, store and add id to pokeSearchRequest.pokesighting[]
					- if existing,  get id and add to pokeSearchRequest.pokesighting[]
			- feed data back to client

		run serverSearchRequest


	design Decisions:
		- should I do this in Meteor
			- pros: 
				- existing data storage mechanisms
				- server does polling
				- mapping libraries already integrated for improved features
				- routing and organization 
				- can setup on server and access anywhere
			- cons: 
				- Fine I'm doing a Meteor app. 

		- Request will hold reference to sighting to prevent duplicates in the much larger pokesighting colleciton
		- should request running be handled by client
			- NO! while this would ease server strain, it is bad because:
				- more security holes with clients entering data
				- client session must be open to poll data
				- still need to make same number of db calls
		- server controls polling frequency and all requests are on the same schedule
			- it is unnecesarily complicated for requests to dictate how often they run.


	Constructino plan:
	1) setup already created pokemonRaising functionality
	2) pokemonFinding
		- given pokeRequest --> update request and create sightings;
		- add logic to prevent duplicating sightings
		- automate pokeRequest re-runs
		- add input ui to create pokeSearchRequest
			- onCreate methods to perform initial search
		- add mapping
